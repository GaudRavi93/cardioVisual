    <p>We don&rsquo;t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</p>
    <p>We don&rsquo;t store personal information on our servers unless required for the ongoing operation of one of our services.</p>
    <p>Below is our privacy policy, which incorporates these goals.</p>
    <p>If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data 
    <!-- <p>If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@cardiovisual.com?Subject=Question%20regarding%20my%20account%20information">info@cardiovisual.com</a> -->

    <p>It is MedicalVisual&rsquo;s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our apps.</p>
    <h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
    <p>MedicalVisual,Inc 2019, via its CardioVisual app, collects &mdash; but does not distribute in any way &mdash; personally identifiable information (PII).
    <p>MedicalVisual may disclose to third party services certain personally identifiable information listed below:
    a.)information you provide us such as email, device IMEI number.
    b.)information we collect as you access and use our service, including device information, location and network carrier
    This information is shared with third party service providers so that we can:
    a.)personalize the app for you 
    b.)perform behavioral analytics</p>
    <p>From time to time, MedicalVisual may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its apps.</p>
    <h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
    <p>MedicalVisual discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on MedicalVisual&rsquo;s behalf, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using the CardioVisual app, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. MedicalVisual will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, MedicalVisual discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when MedicalVisual believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of MedicalVisual, third parties or the public at large. If you are a user of the CardioVisual app, and have supplied your email address, MedicalVisual may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what&rsquo;s going on with MedicalVisual and our products. We expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. MedicalVisual takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
    <h3>Business Transfers</h3>
    <p>If MedicalVisual or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that MedicalVisual goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of MedicalVisual may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>
    <h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
    <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, MedicalVisual may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in MedicalVisual&rsquo;s sole discretion. MedicalVisual encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this app after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
